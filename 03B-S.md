## B. Count the Number of Pairs

        time limit per test: 2 seconds
        memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
        input: standard input
        output: standard output

Kristina has a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. For each pair of lowercase letter and its matching uppercase letter, Kristina can get 1 burl (score). However, pairs of characters cannot overlap, so each character can only be in one pair.

For example, if she has the string `s = "aAaaBACacbE"`, she can get a burl for the following character pairs:

> `s1 = "a" and s2= "A"`

> `s4 = "a" and s6 = "A"`

> `s5 = "B" and s10 = "b"`

> `s7= "C" and s9 = "c"`

Kristina wants to get more burles for her string, so she is going to perform no more than `k` operations on it. In one operation, she can:

- either select the lowercase character `si (1≤i≤n)` and make it uppercase.
- or select uppercase character `si (1≤i≤n)` and make it lowercase.

For example, when `k = 2` and `s = "aAaaBACacbE"` it can perform one operation: choose s3 = "a" and make it uppercase. Then she will get another pair of `s3 = "A"` and `s8 = "a"`

Find **maximum** number of burles Kristina can get for her string.

### Input

The first line of input data contains a single integer `t (1≤t≤104)` — the number of test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers `n (1≤n≤2⋅105)` and `k (0≤k≤n)` — the number of characters in the string and the maximum number of operations that can be performed on it.

The second line of each test case contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n`
over all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10 ^ 5`.

### Output

For each test case, print exactly one integer on a separate line: the maximum number of burles that Kristina can get for her string `s`.

### Example

#### Input

```
5
11 2
aAaaBACacbE
2 2
ab
4 1
aaBB
6 0
abBAcC
5 3
cbccb

```

### Output

```
5
0
1
3
2

```

### Note

The first test case is explained in the problem statement.

In the second test case, it is not possible to get any pair by performing any number of operations.
