## A. Is It a Cat?

        time limit per test: 2 seconds
        memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
        input: standard input
        output: standard output

You were walking down the street and heard a sound. The sound was described by the string s

consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin characters. Now you want to find out if the sound was a cat meowing.

For the sound to be a meowing, the string can only contain the letters 'm', 'e', 'o' and 'w', in either uppercase or lowercase. Also:

- string must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'm' or 'M'
- it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'e' or 'E'
- it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'o' or 'O'
- it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'w' or 'W', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string end

For example, strings "meow", "mmmEeOWww", "MeOooOw" describe a meowing, but strings "Mweo", "MeO", "moew", "MmEW", "meowmeow" do not.

Determine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.

### Input

The first line of input data contains a single integer t
(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
(1≤n≤50) — the length of the string describing the sound.

The second line of each test case contains a string s
of `n` characters. The string describes the sound you heard and consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

### Output

For each test case, output on a separate line:

> `YES` if the sound was a cat meowing;

> `NO` otherwise.

You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive response).

### Example

#### Input

```
7
4
meOw
14
mMmeoOoWWWwwwW
3
mew
7
MmeEeUw
4
MEOW
6
MmyaVW
5
meowA
```

#### Output

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO
```

### Note

In the first test case, the string consists of a sequence of characters 'm', 'e', 'O', 'w', which satisfies the definition of meowing.

In the second test case, the string consists of a sequence of 3
characters 'm' and 'M', one 'e', a sequence of 3 characters 'o' and 'O' and a sequence of 7

characters 'w' and 'W', which satisfies the definition of meowing.

In the third test case, the string does not describe a meowing because it lacks a sequence of 'o' or 'O' characters between 'e' and 'w'.

In the fourth test case, the string contains the character 'U', so it does not describe a meowing.
